# Introduction
This project came about as a request from a chemistry teacher at the high school where I work. They wanted to model bonds between molecules and that was when I was introduced to the concept of an inverter magnet. Essentially, they wanted me to construct something that would work like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSNU9GN-NJI

I went through various iterations and combinations of magnets before I got something that could work and what I show here is my progress – so far – with creating an inverter magnet.

# 3D-Printed Inverter Magnet (Magnets Holder)

The design I settled on utilizes one interior magnet alongside ten exterior magnets. I designed it on OnShape and then proceeded to print it using my Original Prusa Mini+ and using PrusaSlicer.

# Magnets - Arrangement and Material(s)
This is the most important part because wrongfully attaching magnets will cause issues with the magnetic field and thereby making the “tractor beam” effect null.
## Magnets Arrangement
To make this inverter work, we need two sets of “magnets”. The first is made up of two 20mm diameter, 3mm thickness neodymium magnets stacked on top of each other, like so:

The second is for the 3D printed part. Take 4 5mm diameter, 1 mm thickness magnets, stacked on top of each other, and make sure they repel the two large magnets. Create ten sets of these and insert them into the 3D-printed part like so:

After doing this, take another 20mm diameter, 3mm thickness magnet and make sure it attracts the two 20mm diameter, 3mm thickness magnets stacked on top of each other. Place three 12mm diameter, 2mm thickness neodymium magnets atop the center of the first 20mm diameter, 3 mm thickness magnet, followed by two 10mm diameter, 2mm thickness neodymium magnets on top as well. Push this into the 3D-printed part.

Congratulations, you now have a fully-assembled inverter magnet! Time to test it! Hopefully you will see something like this:

# Tips
It is highly recommended to do this on a flat surface that is smooth; for example, doing it on a laminated surface seems to work really well.

It is also important to move slowly with the magnet because it does have an uneven magnetic field in the configuration that I have at the moment.
